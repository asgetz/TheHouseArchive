# TheHouseArchive
A small HTML/JavaScript program designed to help the user keep track of favorited housing market postings.

As it currently stands this program runs by downloading the files and running the html file from your computer. Right now it is extremely bare bones, and as time goes on features will be added. 

To run: download the zip file, unzip the file, and simply double click the "main_page.html" file.
