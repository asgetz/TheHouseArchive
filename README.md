# TheHouseArchive
A small HTML/JavaScript program designed to help the user keep track of favorited housing market postings.

As it currently stands this program runs by downloading the files and running the "main_page.html" file from your computer. Right now it is extremely bare bones, and as time goes on features will be added. 

To run: download the zip file, unzip the file, and simply double click the "main_page.html" file.

UPDATE 1 (February 11th, 2020): Added a create profile page and a login field to the main page. The Profile creation page works and stores the email and password to your local storage on the web-browser.
  The login field currently does nothing at the moment, but this will soon change.
